# Wordle Game in Python

This project is a simple **Wordle game** built using Python's Tkinter library.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI** with Tkinter.
- Feedback on guesses using **green**, **yellow**, and **red** color codes.
- Character tracking for already guessed letters.

## How to Play
1. **Enter a 5-letter word** in the input box.
2. After each guess, letters will be color-coded:
   - üíö **Green** if the letter is in the correct position.
   - üíõ **Yellow** if the letter is in the word but wrong position.
   - ‚ù§Ô∏è **Red** if the letter is not in the word.

3. You have **6 attempts** to guess the correct word.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wordle-game.git

    ```

3. Run the game:
